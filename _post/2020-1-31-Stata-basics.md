title: Basic commands in Stata

When exploring a new dataset, the first command I would like to use is ```describe```. Then I might use commands like ```sum``` and ```codebook```. Here is an example.

![describe](/images/describe.jpg "describe")

![sum](/images/sum.jpg "sum")

![codebook](/images/codebook.jpg "codebook")

![tab](/images/tab.jpg "tab")
