Regression discontinuity tries to discern if there is a break and a slope change at a certain point. Let's look at an example:

We would like to see if there is a jump or a slope change at the point when the law was passed. We use three variables, where instances is the number of crime instances in Michigan, syg is an indicator variable for whether the law exists in the specific month, and time increases by one each month:
