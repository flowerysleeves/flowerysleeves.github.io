1 Intro

Combinations of prediction methods ("ensembles") perform better than individual methods.

2 A Simple Example

Two independent variables that are independent of each other and one dependent variable. There are multiple ways to combine them.

3 Methods for Synthetic Control Problems

Predict the missing value.

There are three methods to do it. Synthetic control methods:

Unconfoundedness or Horizontal Regression (HZ)

Matrix Completion (MC) Methods

4 Ensemble Methods

Methods to combine these three synthetic control methods together:

Vertical Crossvalidation (VC)
