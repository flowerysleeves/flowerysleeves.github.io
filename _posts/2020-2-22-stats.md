title: Question 1 Part c) on Paul Cichello's First Midterm
---

If we had measured totpop in people rather than millions of people how would your answer to b have changed (if at all)? Be specific.

If there were two states, one with 2 mil people and the other with 4 mil people, then the average between these two states would be 3 mil people. The variance would be 1/2*((2 - 3)^2 + (4 - 3)^2). If the unit were people instead of millions of people, the variance would increase by a factor of 1 mil sqrd.
