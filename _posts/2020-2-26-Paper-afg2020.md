Paper title:

Loss in the Time of Cholera: Long-Run Impact of a Disease Epidemic on the Urban Landscape

This paper is very good in that they have a very nice finding: areas that are affected at some point will persist to be affected for an extended amount of time. In this case it is a certain neighborhood of London. My takeaway is that poverty is difficult to eradicate. Maybe it'll be nice to read up on gentrification. 

Also they have nice code and good coding convention in Stata.
