title: Stata Macros

Global macro is generated by the following code:
```
cap global dir = "C:\Users\liang\Desktop\111523-V2\aer_replication"
```

Local macros only exist either in the current session, or in the current do file (if the do file is run once).

To substitute the macro contents of a global macro name, the macro name is typed (punctuated)
with a dollar sign ($) in front.
