Data:
  Panel data set containing complete records of the criminal behavior and labor market outcomes of every Norwegian.

Identification:
  2SLS
  People who are incarcerated have different characteristics as people who are not. Therefore, when we regress recidivism on incarceration, we are not capturing the effect of incarceration on recidivism, but factors such as race, gender, age, etc.
  Judge stringency as an instrument for the first stage regression to decide incarceration.
  
Results:
  Incarceration lowers the probability of reoffending within 5 years by 29 percentage points and reduce the corresponding number of criminal charges per individual by 11.
  This reduction is mainly attributed to people who are unemployed prior to imprisonment. Prison education provides them with opportunities for job training.
