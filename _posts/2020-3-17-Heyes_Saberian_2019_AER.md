  United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA):
    Daily pollution data

Method
  Empirical Strategy:
    Linear probability model
  Comments:
    The method in this paper is relatively basic, only linear probability model. However, the data is very rich. It has over 250,000 observations and 572 variables. They have also conducted a wide variety of robustness tests.

Results
  A 10 degree Farenheit increase in case-day temperature reduces decisions favorable to the applicant by 6.55 percent.
